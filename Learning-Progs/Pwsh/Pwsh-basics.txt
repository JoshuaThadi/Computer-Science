Below is the **PowerShell version**, written in the **same pure Markdown format**, ready to be appended directly to your `README.md`.
No wrapping, no emojis, professional style.

# Move a File Using PowerShell

## Syntax

```powershell
Move-Item source_file destination_folder
```

## Example

Move `file.txt` to a folder named `myfolder`:

```powershell
Move-Item file.txt myfolder
```

## Move with full paths

```powershell
Move-Item C:\Users\Username\Desktop\file.txt C:\Users\Username\Documents\myfolder
```

## Rename while moving

```powershell
Move-Item file.txt myfolder\newname.txt
```

## Move multiple files

```powershell
Move-Item *.txt myfolder
```

## If the folder does not exist

```powershell
New-Item myfolder -ItemType Directory
Move-Item file.txt myfolder
```

## Notes

* PowerShell cmdlets are object-based, not text-based.
* `Move-Item` works for both files and directories.
* Administrator privileges may be required for protected paths.
